# Nikkie's Bookmark App

https://thinkful-ei26.github.io/nikkie-bookmarks-app/

## Features
1. User can see any bookmarks they've previously added (if the server hasn't deleted them) on page load. Bookmarks default to condensed view on page load 

2. User can add bookmarks to their bookmark list. Bookmarks must include a title and a URL, and can include an optional description and rating (1-5 stars)

3. User can click on "more details" to get an expanded view of the bookmark, and on "less details" to see a condensed view of the bookmark. Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

4. User can remove bookmarks from their bookmark list

5. User receives appropriate feedback when they can't submit a new bookmark, or an update for a bookmark (API handles validations) 

6. User can select from a dropdown a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection

## Extended Features
1. User can edit title, url, description, and rating of a bookmark

2. User is prompted to confirm that they want to delete a bookmark incase they hit the button accidentally 

3. While adding a bookmark, user does not have the ability to edit any of their bookmarks. While editing a bookmark, user does not have the ability to add a bookmark or edit other bookmarks

4. When the user hovers over the edit or trash icon, a small pop up of what that icon is for appears

5. User's rating is converted into stars for a visually appealing rating look

6. User is told how many bookmarks are their list
